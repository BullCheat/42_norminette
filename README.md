# 42_norminette
## NO MERCY ! norminette of 42's school DUMPED and running successfully on GNU/Linux

## DON'T FORGET TO READ [THE WIKI](https://github.com/colundrum/42_norminette/wiki)

## WHY ?
I refuse to work on voluntary limited system, I need a professional workflow and the required hardware.
I can't work on Xamarin Studio due to a missing dependency and other reasons.
I know my system, his configuration, and it's reliable to work.

## WHO ?
Me and someone else who prefers to remain anonymous

## What you can find :
- all required files dumped from imac
- shell script to deploy it on your workstation

## Install it :
`./setup.sh`

## Use it :
Open your terminal and execute **`42norminette`**
I recommand you to create an alias **`norminette=42norminette`**

We use 42norminette by security ! If another program want this name and it's not linked to 42's school tools, it breaks the symlink.

## Revisions :
- Saturday 20, June 2015 : High frequency testing in progress, all files aren't pushed
- Tuesday 14, July 2015 : Push all norminette files except install scripts that need optimization
- Tuesday 18, August 2015 : All files pushed

## DON'T FORGET TO USE [42_vogsphere_access](https://github.com/colundrum/42_vogsphere_access)

##Welcome to the freedom to work anywhere in 42's school, outside of clusters
